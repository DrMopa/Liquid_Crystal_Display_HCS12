# Liquid_Crystal_Display_HCS12
Controlling a Liquid Crystal Display using an HCS12 Microcontroller.

Using a 12 segment, 2 row liquid crystal display, we produce an output of "Hello World" onto the display. 
Unfortunately this code is near impossible to compile and run yourself at home, as you will need an identical pin layout, for-which I no longer have the blueprint for. This piece of code is much more of an example as to how to control loops and program HCS12 registers correctly. 

Use the Wookie IDE to verify functionality.
